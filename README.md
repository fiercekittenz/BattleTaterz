# BattleTaterz
## About
BattleTaterz is a small, "pick 3" puzzle game developed as the result of hitting a huge milestone during the St. Jude PlayLIVE prize season of 2022. The Sewhalla (twitch.tv/fiercekittenz) community is amazing and a huge inspiration for all of the quirky fun in the game.

## Engine
This project proudly uses the Godot Engine, which is open source and accessible!

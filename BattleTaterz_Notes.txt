- Split RequestTileMove() into two methods.
	- One will just relocate the tile without doing any animation.
	- The other will create a move request and add it to a queue.
- Once compression is done:
	- Maybe order the list? Map? Whatever?
	- Flag the game board as ready to animate.
- _Process() will see we're ready to animate and start to pull one off the list at a time. They should be ordered already thanks to recursion.
